## Covid 19 Python

Welcome to the COVID-19 data analysis using Python! In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the COVID-19 data provided by Our World in Data (OWID). 
Using Python and Pandas, I explored the data, identified trends, and created visualizations to better understand the global impact of COVID-19.

The project involves two main phases: EDA using Python and Pandas, and data visualization. During the EDA phase, I examined the data structure, calculated descriptive statistics, and identified any missing values or anomalies. 
In the visualization phase, I used Pandas to create advanced visualizations
